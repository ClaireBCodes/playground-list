# Playground List

## Outline

This project is to make a list of all the public playgrounds in the Blue Mountains, NSW, Australia

I have a kid and we are always looking out for somewhere new to explore. Many of the smaller playgrounds are 
not included on the "top 10" lists, or do not pop up on a quick online search. This list will hopefully allow
us and other parents to find local playgrounds, new placed to go, or lunch stops for tourists passing through 
with thier kids. 

I will aim to keep it up to date on the facilities, however this is a solo project for fun so no guarentees!

## Tech Stack
Vite Framework with Node and React
Storybook for interface testing
Vitest for unit testing
Bootstrap for formatting and responsive design
Typescript
Claude Code for AI assistance

I have chosen this tech stack as I want to learn Typescript and how to use Storybook and Claude. I do use AI 
during development, but in moderation and mostly for fiddly time consuming tasks like preparing json files, and
as a bugfixing assistant.

## Design
Simple bootstrap react components
default colour scheme for now and a header image
Three pages - playgrounds, About, my top 10

### PC and larger screens
Header with image and title
Side bar menu with town names to easily jump. Arranged East - West along highway
Search bar
Main page area with three pages (nav menu at top under header)
Playgrounds display on tiles with Name, town, image, badges for facilities and equipment, comment and map preview
maybe 3 tiles on wide, 2 tiles as shrinks down
Open tile into a Modal with Name, town, images, badge and list of facilities, comments and bigger map preview (in open in maps link)
footer with contact feedback link and basic disclaimer

### Mobile and smaller screens
Header with image and title
nav bar with search
tiles take full width, but are stubby with Name, Town, badges and map preview
Modal for tiles is same as large screens with all the details

## Deployment
Initially this will be deployed on GitHub as a project page. I would like to move it to a proper hosting service
later, especially as I add photos and hopefully get some traffic.

## future
add Bells Line of Road and Lithgow area
Add a map page showing all the playgrounds with links to their modal cards and Google maps. Either an image or a google map
See if I can get some advertising from local businesses like cafes 
KoFi or donations page for hosting costs
search engine considerations
